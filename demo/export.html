    <h1>CONTRACT</h1>
                                                <p>In the event of any conflict, this Stipulation/Terms and Conditions will prevail over all other documents. All documents, including the Exhibitor Service Manual, can be found online at <a href="https://www.semiconindia.org">www.semiconindia.org</a>. This Contract is entered into between an exhibiting company <strong>("Exhibitor")</strong> and SEMI India <strong>(“SEMI”)</strong>.</p>

                                                <p>Booth space assignment is based on a regional point system. Only SEMI Members can build and use points. Should the requested space be previously assigned or the floor layout change, SEMI will make reasonable efforts to provide suitable alternate space based on when application and payment were received. An Exhibitor's ultimate placement by SEMI shall be considered final, provided that SEMI reserves the rights to relocate an Exhibitor at any time, at its sole discretion, for the overall good of the show. SEMI is not obligated to reimburse the Exhibitor for any costs arising from such relocation.</p>

                                                <h2>PAYMENT TERMS</h2>

If an Exhibitor does not comply with these Payment Terms, SEMI reserves the right to release such Exhibitor's space for re-assignment, and shall be entitled to retain the 40% non-refundable deposit. Applicable prevailing India tax, (currently GST 18%) will be additional and due on 15 Aug 2025. Exhibiting companies will receive a tax invoice including GST on 1 August.</p>

                                                <h2>GENERAL RULES, TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h2>

If approved, such use shall be in accordance with applicable trademark law and SEMI’s trademark guidelines as revised from time to time.

                                                <h2>EVENT CANCELLATION / CHANGE OF EXHIBIT</h2>
                                                <p>If SEMI should be unable to hold the exhibition for any cause beyond its reasonable control, or if it cannot permit the Exhibitor to occupy its space due to causes beyond SEMI’s reasonable control,SEMI has the right to cancel the exhibit with no further liability than a refund of the stand space rental less a proportionate share of the exhibition expenses incurred by SEMI.SEMI shall in no event be liable for incidental or consequential damages to Exhibitor arising from or relating to such cancellation. Should Exhibitor's display and/or material fail to arrive, Exhibitor is nevertheless responsible for the rental of its exhibit space.</p>

If the above insurance is written on a claims-made form, it will continue for two (2) years following the Event. Such coverage and limits will not in any way limit the liability of Exhibitor. If requested, Exhibitor must furnish SEMI with certificates of insurance evidencing compliance with all requirements, and Exhibitor will promptly notify SEMI of any material modification of the insurance policies. Such certificates will provide for thirty (30) days' advance written notice to SEMI of any cancellation of insurance policies; indicate that SEMI has been endorsed as an additional insured under such coverage; and include a provision that the coverage will be primary and will not participate with, nor will be excess over, any valid and collectable insurance or program of self-insurance maintained by SEMI.</p>

                                                <h2>CANCELLATION OR REDUCTION OF EXHIBIT SPACE BY EXHIBITING COMPANY</h2>
                                                <ol>
                                                    <li>In the event of cancellation (partial or full) a written notice must be received by SEMI.</li>
                                                    <li>If canceled <strong>on or before April 30, 2025</strong>, a <strong>cancellation fee of 40%</strong> of the canceled space will be assessed by SEMI.</li>
                                                    <li>If canceled <strong>after April 30, 2025</strong>, a <strong>cancellation fee of 100%</strong> of the canceled space will be assessed by SEMI.</li>
                                                    <li>SEMI will issue the final invoice reflecting all fees imposed on Exhibitor's account per the terms and conditions of this Contract.</li>

                                                <p>Reduction of exhibit space may result in booth relocation. SEMI reserves the right to reassign cancelled booth space, regardless of the liquidated damage assessment. Subsequent reassignment of cancelled space does not relieve the canceling Exhibitor of the obligation to pay the assessment. SEMI must receive written notification of any cancellation. All booths must be set and show ready by 6:00 pm on the day prior to the opening of the event. Failure to do so will be considered a cancellation unless SEMI has been notified and has approved in advance otherwise.</p>

                                                <p>The relationship between the parties is that of independent contractors. Exhibitor is not an employee, agent, partner or legal representative of SEMI and shall have no authority to assume or create obligations on behalf of SEMI or the Event.Exhibitor shall not assign to a third party its rights, or obligations, or any portion thereof without the prior written consent of SEMI, which consent SEMI may grant or withhold at its sole discretion. Any attempted assignment without such consent by SEMI shall be void and of no effect and shall constitute a material breach by Exhibitor of its obligations hereunder. SEMI shall have the right to subcontract to a third party its rights, or obligations, or any portion thereof.This Contract is the only agreement between the parties pertaining to its subject matter, and supersedes any draft or prior or contemporaneous agreement, discussion, or representation (whether written or oral) between the parties.

This agreement may be amended or modified in a writing signed by each party.Aside from the parties hereto, no other person or entity is entitled to benefit from the rights and obligations hereunder and there are no third-party beneficiaries hereto.</p>
                                                <p>The failure of either party to assert a right hereunder or to insist upon compliance with any term or condition of this agreement will not constitute a waiver of that right or excuse a similar subsequent failure to perform any such term or condition by the other party. None of the terms and conditions of this Contract can be waived except by the written consent of the Party waiving compliance.If any provision of this agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then the remaining provisions will nevertheless remain in full force and effect, and the parties shall negotiate in good faith a substitute, valid, and enforceable provision that most nearly reflects the parties’ intent in entering into this Contract.</p>
